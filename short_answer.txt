1) What is the difference between a client and a server? In the HTTP protocol,
which one of these sends requests, and which one sends responses?

The differnces between a client and a server is that a client initiates communication
by sending a request and the server responds to those requests by sending back the information that was requested.  
Say a user was to go online shopping on Amazon, when a client clicks the link on an item they would want to purchase,
the browser sends an HHTP request to the server to retrieve the web page. The server processes the action and sends a
HTTP response back to the client.

-------------------
2) What do we mean by a "route" on a server?

A route on a server refers to the endpoint that corresponds to a particular function on the server. It defines how the
server should respond to a specific HTTP request.

-------------------
3) The steps below de describe what happens when a user goes to
a URL like https://facebook.com/home in their browser, but are out of order.
Put them in the correct order from start to finish.

- The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
- The user's browser displays the HTML it recieved
- The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
- The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
- The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter

The user types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter.
The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route/home.
The server runs a function associated with the route /home, which produces some HTML.
The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response.
The user's browser displays the HTML received.
